# Kinsey Roberts's Code Sample for ApartmentList

## To run

The code compiles for both .NET Framework 4.0 and .NET Core 2.0. 
The latter should allow for cross-platform execution on Linux or macOS systems with .NET Core installed.

* If running Windows with .NET Framework 4.0 or greater installed: 
    1. `cd wordbook.net.4.0\bin\Debug`
    2. `wordbook.exe`
* If running Linux, or macOS with .NET Core 2.0 installed:
    1. `cd wordbook.net.core.2.0`
    2. `dotnet run`
